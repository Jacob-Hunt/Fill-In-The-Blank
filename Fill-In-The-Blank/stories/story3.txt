It is a truth universally {past-tense verb}, that a single man in possession of a good {noun}, must be in want of a {type of person}.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first {verb ending in 'ing'} a {noun}, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding {type of person, plural}, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their {type of person, plural}.
